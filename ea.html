						<h2>External Analysis</h2>
					</header>
					<p> The result of the survey overall was not what I expected. All of the ratings my peers gave me are higher than what I gave myself except for the categories of communications and empathy. As I was going back to each individual question, I started to recall my thinking process when I was answering each question. Whenever I saw a problem, I immediately thought through all of the events that have happened prior to that particular experience. The ones that I didn’t behave as well always get my attention because they are usually associated with emotions like awkwardness and upset. Therefore, I scored myself with that particular instance of specialty in my experience. However, as for my peers, they don’t know me in all kinds of situations, and may therefore, happened to be in the situation when I had dealt with the problems well. Because of that, I think the result of the survey is only suggestive, it definitely shows a trend but does not convey the most accurate evaluation either from me or from my peers.</p>        
					<p>Since most of the ratings my peers gave me are higher than what I gave myself, the two categories that are the opposite grabbed my immediate attention. To my surprise, I gave myself full point of 5.0 on communications; while the rating from my peers is 4.4, which is not only lower than my rating, but also lower than the average rating my peers tend to rate me in other categories. This is truly out of my expectations. As I was looking back to each question, I still believed that I could utilize those skills in one way or another. However, then I realized that I only used engaging style, nonverbal cues and visual aids when I was presenting something formally in class or in a meeting. My peers might not be there for my presentations; and inferring from our daily conversations, they couldn’t find that clear and convincing presenting skills in me. Indeed, I made my personalities and behaviors too distinct in different roles and situations. I’m only able to present clear information if I fully prepare for them, like in a meeting. However, as for daily life, I don’t always use engaging style when I talk to people because I’m not in the mood; I’m not interested in the topic or the person, etc. This is something I really want to improve. I want to prepare myself and show the outside world the best me at all times. I want to always be prepared for my friends, my families, and all kinds of situations. I want people to see my passion, not only in a meeting or presentation, but also in daily life. After taking this class, I’ve learn many things about emotional intelligence skills. I learned how to deal with situations inside out. I learned how to manage my own emotions so other people would feel comfortable with me. I’m aware that people do present themselves differently in different situations. However, no matter whom I’m with and what situation I’m in, I want to present myself as a passionate, fully prepared and engaging person. I think this will never go wrong.</p>        
					<p>Another category that people rate me lower is the category of empathy. Especially for the first question “I accurately read people’s moods or nonverbal cues”, someone even gave me a 3. In a survey that 98% of my peers’ ratings are 4 and 5, a rating of 3 really symbolizes something. I thought I was good at reading people’s mood. Although I can’t eliminate the possibility of that one person has been in a one particular instance with me where I was too ignorant to realize his mood, I still want to make sure that I can be accurate when examining people’s emotions. To do that, I need to gain awareness of feeling people’s emotions. I want to always turn my senses on to receive people’s cues. I want to be sensitive to people from diverse background and appreciate what and why people are saying. This is one of the values that I value the most. I want people to think of me when they have emotional issues. I want to be the support for my friends and families. In order for people to trust my suggestions and judgments, I need to first make good judgments myself. In addition, I think sometimes I care and understand on the inside but don’t know how to express my understanding to them. This may also cause them to misunderstand me as ignorant. This might be due to my shyness of expressing my feelings especially when the subject is sensitive. I would also like to improve on that. I would love to learn the appropriate methods to communicate with my peers so they could feel my presence. The most important action I would like to do to improve my verbal skills is practicing. I will start with my friends about issues that are not as sensitive, tell them I’m with them, and express how I personally feel about the situation. Only this way will I get to build a connection with them, show my empathy, and let them know my intention of understanding.</p>        
					<p>In addition to the discrepancies in my report (my blind spots), I’ve also found something fairly interesting. The lowest score of my rating and my peers lie into the same category: initiative. During the class when the lecturer asked us to list one or two clusters that are important for us, I totally ignored that category as well. I think I’m a more logical and rational person. I like to wait until the reasons are super clear before taking actions because I don’t like to deal with unexpected consequences. I have to also admit that I really don’t know how to seek information in unusual ways. I do lack some innovative and creative ideas. I think this is partially due to my tight daily schedule. I’m always too busy with schoolwork and projects that I don’t have time to settle down and just think about ideas. Schoolwork is usually too rigid which constraints my thinking process as the time progresses. I would like to improve it by taking time off once in a while, reading some interesting books and writing my ideas off on my journals to keep practicing. I also hardly ever cut through red tape or bend the rules when necessary. I’m from a culture that avoids trouble when encountering problems with the rules. This has to be changed because it shows my dedication and determinedness. The best way to do it is to gain my confidence. When I’m able to come up with a reasonable idea and have done enough research to back it up, I will gain confidence to shoot for the direction and goals that might requires certain rules to be bent.</p>         
					<p>I did a good job passing both me and my peer’s examination of self-awareness. This is the cluster where my highest scores are in. Overall, I’m able to gain awareness of my own emotions and present myself in an assured and unhesitating manner. This is a value that I really cherish. I want to make sure I could keep it while working on using the awareness. Often times, although I’m aware my emotions, I still have difficulties coping and controlling them. I rated myself relatively low in emotional self-control category because of that. My friend even gave me a 2 on “I deal calmly with stress”. Apparently, my extreme emotions seem really obvious. Having the awareness is really important, but I want to learn more smart ways to utilize my emotions for optimized result. For example, I need to learn time management so I’m also working in “quadrant II” without overly stressing myself. I need to listen empathically so I could feel people’s emotions without judging them to be right or wrong. The techniques we learned in this class will all help me build on my strength of awareness, and compensate for the weaknesses I have such as emotional self-control. </p>
