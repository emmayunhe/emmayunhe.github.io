						<h2>Self Analysis</h2>

					<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
					<p align = "left">As a computer engineer, I pay attention to develop myself not only on technical abilities but also soft skills, so I can prepare myself better when go into the industry. Afterall, the industry needs people with <strong>well-rounded</strong> and combinational skills. Therefore, I’m in the process of getting my business minor to help me gain more experience and background on cooperation and finance in general. I believe that the most important skill that my engineering major gives me is the ability to think critically and analytically, which is crucial for all the situations in the future. In addition, I’m involved in many leadership positions on campus. I’m the vice president of Chinese Student and Scholars Association Business Development Department, which is in charge of corresponding with local businesses to secure funds and sponsorships for all our events. Through frequent negotiations, I have learned many skills upon communications as well as decision making for organizations. Due to the efforts of my team, CSSA has grown dramatically and we are able to cooperate with many major businesses such as BMW and Statefarm.</p>
					<p align = "left">In my technical field, I have completed a variety of projects involving all kinds of concentrations in electrical engineering and computer science. I have high standards in myself and I value <strong>determinedness</strong>. I believe that to do things efficiently, we have to dedicate ourselves mentally first. This involves setting the right goals as well as planning them accordingly so we could give them the time and attentions.</p>
					<p align = "left">Although I’m always determined, I’m not as competitive. I’m a person who’s really easy to talk to. I pay attention to friends’ emotions so I can always be there when they need me. I believe that social network is really important for any individual. It broadens our views and provides more perspectives. It helps us understand issues more objectively, which helps us make right decisions. Only when we understand people from their shoes, will we communicate with them effectively. In the near future, I would like to move up along a coorperation and take a manangement position. Being an <strong>easy-going</strong> person grants me the tools and path to get to know my people and help them overcome difficulties and achieve maximum productivity.</p>
					<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
					<p align = "left">There are many aspects of my personality that I wish I could have done better. For example, since I value the ability to make the right decision, sometimes I have difficulties choosing among the alternatives. I’m sometimes <strong>hesitant</strong> for many different reasons: sometimes I don’t want to take the consequences if things don’t go as I expect; sometimes if I don’t want to make sacrifices on either side of the solution; sometimes I want to both of the results. This personality always gives me struggles. However, through the struggles I have learned priorities. I have learned my individual values more and started to know what matters to me the most. As time goes on, I have become better with making decisions and choosing the right alternative that I would less likely to regret.</p>
					<p align = "left">I’m a little <strong>dominant</strong>, meaning that I don’t always trust people with their decisions. Whenever there is group work, I would always go over everyone’s part to make sure they are doing it right. This has given much inconvenience to both my team and myself. They are frustrated because of my distrust and I’m also exhausting myself because I’m giving me more work than needed.  I check on them once in a while to make sure they are still on track of the work and I keep reminding them if they seem to slack off. It turns out that this method usually doesn’t give what I needed. Since I took too much initiative, people tend to slack off more because they knew I would get everything done eventually. I lose connections with the group mates since they don’t see trust in me. The group work became more of a burden for me than what it’s supposed to serve. However, as I took more leadership roles, I started to learn to let go. I started to divide up the work and trust people with what I assigned. The results have been significant. People are more willing to dedicate themselves into the projects because they are given trust. I have learned to control my dominance to a certain extend.</p>
					<p align = "left">My third weakness connects with my second one in some way. Since I’d like to get things done fast and efficiently, I have little tolerance of waiting. This applies to everything from work, project to even daily conversations. It would even bother me if people talk too slow. They make me anxious when they talk all over the place but not to the point. This is something that I still need to work on. The respect I have upon people makes it an internal struggle for myself. I don’t want to interrupt them, while I’m <strong>impatient</strong>ly waiting for them to finish. Sometimes it affects my ability to listen to ideas. Therefore, I would like to improve on this trait by sometimes slowing myself down and enjoying the life and conversations. </p>
